== Welcome to Vines Services

Vines Services are dynamically updated groups of systems based on criteria like
hostname, installed software, operating system, etc. Send a command to the
service and it runs on every system in the group. Services, files and permissions
are managed via the bundled web application.

Services are defined using VinesQL, a simple query language that finds systems
based on their machine attributes. A "Mac OS X Lion" service might be
defined as: platform is 'mac_os_x' and platform_version starts with '10.7'.
As machines update to Lion, they will join this service automatically and may
be managed as one group.
